# employee-tracker-cli

A node.js application that tracks employees using a mysql database

I have create an app that tracks employee's in a few different ways.

You can view each employee, their role within the company, their current salary, and which department they work for.

You can update each employee's role,salary, and also the department the new role will fall under.

You can add new employee's as well with custom roles, salary, and departments.

I used mySql to build the database.

I used Inquirer and Node.js to run the app.

I hope you enjoy this app, it was fun to make.
